    <h1>Benedetta (Bennie) Giocoli</h1>
    <p>I am an MPhil student in Comparative Government at the Department of Politics and International Relations (DPIR), University of Oxford and a member of Lincoln College. My current research aims to identify the mechanisms of early political socialisation within the family using long-running household panel surveys from the United Kingdom. More broadly, I am interested in studying the formation of political attitudes, identities, and preferences using quantitative methods. My studies at Oxford are fully funded by a DPIR Studentship. I also hold a Senior Scholarship at Lincoln College. </p>

    </p>I previously obtained a First Class Honours BSc in Philosophy, Politics and Economics with Social Data Science from University College London.</p>
